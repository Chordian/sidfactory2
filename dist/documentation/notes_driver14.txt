Driver 14.00 - The Experiment
=============================

Versions
--------

  o  14.00: This driver has an experimental approach to writing to the SID. It allows for
            very short durations of gate off but also has a greater chance of instability


Instruments
-----------

  Byte 0 - AD
  Byte 1 - SR
  Byte 2 - Flags (see below)
  Byte 3 - Filter table index
  Byte 4 - Pulse table index
  Byte 5 - Wave table index

Flags:

      80 - Enable "immediate response" type hard restart
      40 - Start filter program (filter table index in byte 3 is then used)


Commands
--------

00 XX YY - Slide up/down        XXYY = 16-bit speed
01 XX YY - Vibrato              XX   = frequency            YY  = amplitude             (use smaller amplitude values for stronger vibrato)


Wave
----

   XX YY - Waveform/semitones   XX   = waveform             YY  = 00-7f = semitones added to note in sequence
                                                                  80-df = absolute semitone value (use for e.g. drums)
   7f XX - Jump to index        XX   = table index


Pulse
-----

8X XX YY - Set pulse width      XXX  = pulse width          YY  = number of frames      (when YY is done it goes to the next row)
0X XX YY - Add to pulse         XXX  = add to pulse width   YY  = number of frames      (when YY is done it goes to the next row)
7f -- XX - Jump to index        XX   = table index                                      (jumping to own index will end the program)


Filter
------

XY YY RB - Set filter if X > 8  X    = passband (9-F)       YYY = 12-bit cutoff         R = resonance           B = channel select bitmask
0X XX YY - Add to cutoff        XXX  = add to cutoff        YY  = number of frames      (when YY is done it goes to the next row)
7f -- XX - Jump to index        XX   = table index                                      (jumping to own index will end the program)
