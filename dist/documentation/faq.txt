Q: Why can't I start SID Factory II? It just displays an error message.

A: If you're using an anti-virus program, check to see it's not blocking it. You may
   have to whitelist both the .exe and the .dll files for it to work.

   Especially Avast, F-Secure and Norton AntiVirus have been known to do this.

Q: SID Factory II crashes when I try to start it. Why is that?

A: One thing you can try on your own is to replace the SDL2.dll with a "stable"
   version from the http://libsdl.org web site.

   Either way, we would appreciate it a lot if you please tell us about it. See the
   first entry above for information about how to contact us.
