Instruments
-----------

  Byte 0 - AD
  Byte 1 - SR
  Byte 2 - Flags (see below)
  Byte 3 - Filter table index
  Byte 4 - Pulse table index
  Byte 5 - Wave table index

Flags:

      80 - Enable hard restart
      40 - Start filter program (filter table index in byte 3 is then used)
      20 - [11.03] Enable filter on channel (combined with bitmask set in filter program)
      10 - Oscillator reset (waveform 09 is used in the first frame of a note)
      0X - Hard restart table index


Commands
--------

T0 XX YY - Slide up/down        XXYY = 16-bit speed
T1 XX YY - Vibrato              XX   = frequency            YY  = amplitude             (use smaller amplitude values for stronger vibrato)
T2 XX YY - Portamento           XXYY = 16-bit speed                                     (use 02 80 00 to disable a portamento running wild)
T3 XX YY - Arpeggio             XX   = arpeggio speed       YY  = arpeggio table index  (use this for chords)
T4 XX YY - [11.01] Fret slide   XX   = 00-7f speed up       YY  = semitones to slide    (only available in driver 11.01+)
                                       80-ff speed down
T8 XX YY - Set local ADSR                                                               (lasts until next note is triggered)
T9 XX YY - Set instrument ADSR                                                          (lasts until a different instrument is used)
Ta -- XX - Filter program       XX   = table index
Tb -- XX - Wave program         XX   = table index
Tc -- XX - [11.02] Pulse prg    XX   = table index                                      (only available in driver 11.02)
Td -- XX - [11.02] Tempo prg    XX   = table index                                      (only available in driver 11.02)
Te -- -X - [11.02] Main volume  X    = 0-f main volume                                  (only available in driver 11.02)
Tf -- XX - Increase demo value  XX   = amount                                           (use this for timing demo parts)
|
T        - [11.04] Note delay   T    = 0-f ticks                                        (only available in driver 11.04)

Wave
----

   XX YY - Waveform/semitones   XX   = waveform             YY  = 00-7f = semitones added to note in sequence
                                                                  80-df = absolute semitone value (use for e.g. drums)
   7f XX - Jump to index        XX   = table index


Pulse
-----

8X XX YY - Set pulse width      XXX  = pulse width          YY  = number of frames      (when YY is done it goes to the next row)
0X XX YY - Add to pulse         XXX  = add to pulse width   YY  = number of frames      (when YY is done it goes to the next row)
7f -- XX - Jump to index        XX   = table index                                      (jumping to own index will end the program)


Filter
------

XY YY RB - Set filter if X > 8  X    = passband (9-F)       YYY = 12-bit cutoff         R = resonance           B = channel select bitmask
0X XX YY - Add to cutoff        XXX  = add to cutoff        YY  = number of frames      (when YY is done it goes to the next row)
7f -- XX - Jump to index        XX   = table index                                      (jumping to own index will end the program)


Arpeggio
--------

      XX - Arp if XX < 70       XX   = semitones to add
      7X - Jump to index        X    = relative index

Example:

00: 0c
01: 07 *1
02: 04 *2
03: 00
04: 71 (jump to *1 if called with command 03 00 00; jump to *2 if called with command 03 00 01)
