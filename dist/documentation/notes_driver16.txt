Driver 16.00 - Tiny, mark II
============================

Versions
--------

  o  16.00: This driver is supposed to be small and is really a variation of driver 15.00
            where all of the variables used by the driver have been moved to the zero page
            addressing space. A linear pulse sweep has been added and the code has been
            optimized to take up as little memory as possible. Hard restart is always on
            and there are no commands available


Instruments
-----------

  Byte 0 - AD
  Byte 1 - SR
  Byte 2 - Pulse width XY       X    = middle 4 bits of pw  Y   = top 4 bits of pw (i.e. 12-bit pulse width)
  Byte 3 - Linear pulse sweep   X    = add to mid 4 bits    Y   = add to top 4 bits
  Byte 4 - Wave table index


Commands
--------

N/A


Wave
----

   XX YY - Waveform/semitones   XX   = waveform             YY  = 00-7f = semitones added to note in sequence
                                                                  80-df = absolute semitone value (use for e.g. drums)
   7f XX - Jump to index        XX   = table index


Known bugs
----------

None
