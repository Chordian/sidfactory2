Editor:

* Markers table: Single click, behaves as Ctrl + G, double click behaves as Ctrl + G and play from event position (same as the orderlist overview)
* Migrate from Import Song Data to Import Driver, this seems more natural
* Duplicate current track [ctrl + d], by copying current sequence, removing sequence entry from orderlist, insert first free sequence in orderlist and paste
* Marking for copy/paste functionality
* Marking for play in loop (not sure this can be done!)
* Remember user folder when exit and restart SF2
* Add ".." to file menues for easier folder navigation
* Ability to add strings to orderlist overview and instruments
* Load and save instruments
* Follow play functionality
* Markers component. Single click [or ENTER], select and move to. Double click [or Ctrl + ENTER] select and play from.
* CTRL + F on index pointers in tables will automatically find next free index in the table pointed to and insert that value before transfering focus the that table.
* Clicking somewhere in the track should move the cursor to that position
* CTRL + Enter in sequence should add 0x10 more rows
DONE * ½ button should fast forward the music when playing
* Button to fill-toggle entire range between a note with gate on (+++)
* Writing the instrument value in a sequence should automatically select the instrument index in the instruments table
* Writing the command value in a sequence should automatically select the command index in the commands table
* Predictive sequence size option (for when adding an unused sequence). Automatically set the size to the size of the previous sequence in the orderlist - or something!
* Check box in quick save dialog box to disable showing the dialog box in the future (until loading a new work file)
* While in the track edit, editing the sequence. CTRL + UP/DOWN, move to the top of this or previous sequence, or top of next if down was pressed!

Utilities:

Bugs:
