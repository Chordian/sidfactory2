SIDFactory II installation
--------------------------

SIDFactory II consists of:

- A macOS application, "SIDFactoryII.app". Drag and drop this into the
  "Applications" folder.

- The folder "SIDFactoryII" with some (optional) extra's:
  - Documentation
  - Example music
  - Alternative drivers
  - The "SF2Converter" command line tool for converting MOD and Goattracker
    tunes to the SF2 format.

Put the folder "SIDFactoryII" somewhere convenient, for example your "Music" or
"Documents" folder.

N.B. When you run SIDFactoryII for the first time, macOS might refuse to open it
because it is from an unidentified developer. In that case do the following:

- Right click the "SIDFactoryII.app" in your applications folder and select 'Open'.
- Select 'Open' if macOS asks you if you are sure.

The folder "SIDFactoryII/documentation" contains a template called "user.default.ini".
Rename this to user.ini and put it in your home directory in the folder .config.
SIDFactory looks for the file ~/.config/user.ini for custom configuration (where ~
is your home directory).
