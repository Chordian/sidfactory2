Things to do for a release build
================================

  o  Verify the overlays to make sure the latest changes are included in them

  o  Make sure all overlays have small file sizes, otherwise run optimize_all_overlays.bat

  o  Update change_log.txt with the latest changes so it's up-to-date with the latest build

  o  Check faq.txt to see if it is needs updating or appending

  o  Make sure any changes or additions to keys are added to the notes.txt too

  o  If you edit or create new text files in documentation, run "TAB to Spaces" in Notepad++ on
     them to make sure they also look good in lesser text editors such as Notepad

  o  Perform the same "TAB to Spaces" treatment to the config.ini file if it has been altered

  o  Update the user manual document and export it to PDF

  o  Make sure the latest version of the converter is copied to the dist folder too

  o  If there were changes to the standard driver, consider if the demo songs could benefit
     from this (such as the description labels) and update them all accordingly if so
