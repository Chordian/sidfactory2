# Source overlay images

Use **Corel PaintShop Pro** to edit these as layers have been used.

When a source image is complete:

- Merge all layers
- Resize to 960x976
- Sharpen once
- Save as PNG in the `SIDFactoryII/overlay` folder

Remember to run the `optimize_all_overlays.bat` later to reduce the monstrous size of all PNG files.
